# Conway's Game of Life #
This application can create in a grid of any size, randomize the initial state of each cell, and generate the "next" state of each iteration.

## Getting Started ##
To run this program you must have Microsoft Visual Studio installed on your device. This program is written in C# and JavaScript.

## Running the program ##
To start the solution in Visual Studio open the Life.sln file and build and execute the solution. Press the "Play the game" button to generate the "next" state of the given grid or select your own grid size and then play.

## Running the tests ##
The program will go to Home/Index by default which will allow you to select a grid size and loop through the cell states.
To go to the game of life tests, simply click the "Go to tests" button.
